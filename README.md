# eShopping
eShopping is My first Project that I used for exams in year 4. And it's the first time that I use Android Studio. It was something new that I studied at that time. Make the code that is not good enough. And some parts, I admit that I copied someone else's But if it were knowledgeable for someone, I would be happy and thankful.
